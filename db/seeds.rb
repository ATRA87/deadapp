#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# The above are the main ones -- two apps, four users, two open orders, one team member, two app owners
# We need several "dead" projects, who will need users, and orders, and ratingsâ€¦

# Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme are the users who have fulfilled orders and left
# reviews on the two main projects.
